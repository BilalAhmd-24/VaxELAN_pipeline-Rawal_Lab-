# VaxELAN_pipeline-Rawal-lab-
Here, we created a proteomics pipeline to identify PVCs from different pathogens (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96863-x)
A case example of Trypanosoma cruzi was utilized in the attached article.

In this pipeline, we used a series of bioinformatics tool to identify protein/proteome charcteristics for different pathogens.

Also, the group has recently published a deep-learning server in PVC Identification. If intersted. Do check the work.
Peace!
